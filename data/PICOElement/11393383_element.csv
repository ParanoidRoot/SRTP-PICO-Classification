9,46 ||| Discussion ||| 3.2 ||| Pretreatment plasma ET-1 levels in vitiligo and psoriasis were found to be elevated above the values of healthy controls in this current study and even above those reported in the literature (2.3-4 pg ⁄ mL).,11393383,plasma ET-1 levels in vitiligo and psoriasis were found to be elevated above the values of healthy controls in this current study,o.Treatment,limingqi
10,"62 ||| Discussion ||| 3.18 ||| In addition, there was a significant indirect correlation between sequential plasma ET-1 and VASI score, indicating that the elevation of plasma ET-1 in response to PUVA therapy is accompanied by generalized hyperpigmentation and repigmentation of vitiligo.",11393383,the elevation of plasma ET-1 in response to PUVA therapy is accompanied by generalized hyperpigmentation and repigmentation of vitiligo,o.Treatment,limingqi
