0,2 |||  ||| 0.2 ||| Objective To compare mortality and morbidity outcomes in patients with hyper-tension and CAD treated with a calcium antagonist strategy (CAS) or a non-calcium antagonist strategy (NCAS).,14657064,compare mortality and morbidity outcomes in patients with hyper-tension and CAD treated with a calcium antagonist strategy (CAS) or a non-calcium antagonist strategy ,pr.Disease,lingtaiwei
1,42 ||| Study Design ||| 2.14 ||| Patients taking ␤-blockers within 2 weeks of randomization or taking ␤-blockers for an MI that occurred in the previous 12 months were excluded to avoid withdrawal phenomena in patients randomized to the CAS group.,14657064,Patients taking ␤-blockers within 2 weeks of randomization or taking ␤-blockers for an MI that occurred in the previous 12 months were excluded ,po.Disease,lingtaiwei
2,"31 ||| Study Design ||| 2.3 ||| We designed a randomized trial, the International Verapamil-Trandolapril Study (INVEST), to compare outcomes in older hypertensive patients with CAD treated with a calcium antagonist strategy (CAS; verapamil sustained release [SR]) or a non-calcium",14657064,compare outcomes in older hypertensive patients with CAD treated with a calcium antagonist strategy ,pr.Disease,lingtaiwei
3,"11 |||  ||| 0.11 ||| In the NCAS group, 6083 patients (77.5%) were taking aten-olol; 4733 (60.3%) were taking hydrochlorothiazide; and 4113 (52.4%) were taking trandolapril.",14657064,6083 patients (77.5%) were taking aten-olol; 4733 (60.3%) were taking hydrochlorothiazide; and 4113 (52.4%) were taking trandolapril,i.Procedure,lingtaiwei
4,"35 ||| Study Design ||| 2.7 ||| Clinically stable CAD patients with hypertension were randomly assigned to either verapamil SR or atenolol for blood pressure treatment according to the sixth report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC VI) (target: systolic blood pressure [SBP] Ͻ140 and diastolic blood pressure [DBP] Ͻ90 mm Hg or SBP Ͻ130 mm Hg and DBP Ͻ85 mm Hg when diabetes or renal impairment is present).",14657064, patients with hypertension were randomly assigned to either verapamil SR or atenolol for blood pressure treatment,i.Procedure,lingtaiwei
5,"152 ||| Baseline Characteristics ||| 5.50 ||| There was a significant interaction between treatment group and prior heart failure, suggesting that those randomized to the atenolol plus hydrochlorothiazide strategy (NCAS group) had better outcomes than those randomized to the verapamil SR plus trandolapril strategy (CAS group).",14657064,atenolol plus hydrochlorothiazide strategy (NCAS group) had better outcomes than those randomized to the verapamil SR plus trandolapril strategy (CAS group).,o.Treatment,lingtaiwei
6,"166 ||| Baseline Characteristics ||| 5.64 ||| The INVEST data also confirm and extend the suggestions of others 7,35 that monotherapy is not necessarily sufficient for optimal treatment of hypertension.",14657064,monotherapy is not necessarily sufficient for optimal treatment of hypertension.,o.Treatment,lingtaiwei
7,16 |||  ||| 0.16 ||| Conclusion The verapamil-trandolapril-based strategy was as clinically effective as the atenolol-hydrochlorothiazide-based strategy in hypertensive CAD patients.,14657064, The verapamil-trandolapril-based strategy was as clinically effective as the atenolol-hydrochlorothiazide-based strategy,o.Treatment,lingtaiwei
