11,"80 ||| Discussion ||| 5.5 ||| The sustained BP control in hypertensive patients treated with bisoprolol observed in this study is consistent with previous reports, and may be explained by the following haemodynamic effects: (i) a blocked increment in CO   with high peripheral vascular resistance but low or normal CO. [28][29][30][31][32][33] However, the unchanged CO and EF at the end of the study indicate that the long-term antihypertensive effect of bisoprolol might be due to a reduction in sympathetic nervous activity, thereby inducing peripheral vascular dilatation rather than a negative inotropism.",19663521,unchanged CO and EF at the end of the study indicate that the long-term antihypertensive effect of bisoprolol might be due to,o.Treatment,limingqi

13,"101 ||| Conclusions ||| 6.3 ||| Bisoprolol is more effective in BP control in that it achieves tighter control of DBP than losartan, and it can be a useful therapeutic option in the management of recently diagnosed hypertensive patients (ESH stage 1-2).",19663521, Bisoprolol is more effective in BP control,o.Treatment,limingqi
