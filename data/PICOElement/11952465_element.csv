0,"39 ||| Material and methods ||| 1.26 ||| The mean induction to vaginal delivery interval in the oral 50 mgs group in our earlier study (6) was 28 h with a standard deviation of 16 h. Taking a shortening of 7 h in this interval for the 100 mgs group as clinically significant, we calculated that 105 patients would be required to give the study a power of 80% (a Ω 0.02, b Ω 0.20; Instat Version 3.01, GraphPad Software Inc, San Diego CA, USA).",11952465,105 patients,po.Size,ml
