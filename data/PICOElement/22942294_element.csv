8,"85 ||| RESULTS ||| 2.32 ||| Notably, our results failed to detect any significant effect of combined antiplatelet therapy on variable internal mammary artery (IMA) graft occlusion which, because it occurs only rarely, needs a larger sample for statistical power and is probably influenced by factors other than SVG.",22942294,failed to detect any significant effect of combined antiplatelet therapy,o.Treatment,奉捷
