8,"94 ||| RESULTS ||| 2.36 ||| Analysis of these trials suggests that the rate of scalp pH testing in the cardiotocography group appears to determine whether the rate of operative delivery for fetal distress decreases with ST-segment analysis: the fewer scalp pH tests that are taken, the fewer operative deliveries for fetal distress.",17826428,"the fewer scalp pH tests that are taken, the fewer operative deliveries for fetal distress.",o.Treatment,lingtaiwei
9,"86 ||| RESULTS ||| 2.28 ||| The Swedish trial of 4966 women in high-risk labor in 3 major obstetrics departments found a significant, but nonetheless somewhat small, reduction in the rate of operative delivery for fetal distress in the STAN group compared with the cardiotocography group (9%-8%; P ϭ .047).",17826428,reduction in the rate of operative delivery for fetal distress in the STAN group,o.Treatment,lingtaiwei
