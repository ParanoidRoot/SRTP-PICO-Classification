0,1 |||  ||| 0.1 ||| Objective: To compare the efficacy and safety of 100 m g oral misoprostol for induction of labor between the regimen of 3 hour and 6 hour interval administration.,12512928,100 m g oral misoprostol for induction of labor,pr.Disease,ml
1,2 |||  ||| 0.2 ||| Methods: Singleton pregnancies indicated for induction of labor between 34 and 42 weeks of gestation in the condition of unfavorable cervix (Bishop score £ 4) and no contraindication for prostaglandins therapy were recruited into the study.,12512928,between 34 and 42 weeks of gestation,po.PhyConditon,ml
2,17 ||| Materials and Methods ||| 2.4 ||| All subjects were randomly assigned to receive 100 m g misoprostol orally every 3 or 6 hours by means of blocked randomization.,12512928,receive 100 m g misoprostol orally every 3 or 6 hours,i.Procedure,ml
3,"21 ||| Materials and Methods ||| 2.8 ||| The medication was repeated every 3 or 6 hours until adequate uterine contraction ( ≥ 3 contractions in 10 min), favorable change of cervix (Bishop score > 4 and favorable enough for amniotomy) or spontaneous rupture of the membranes occurred.",12512928,medication was repeated every 3 or 6 hours,i.Procedure,ml
4,"3 |||  ||| 0.3 ||| All pregnant women were randomly assigned to receive 100 m g oral misoprostol every 3 hours or 6 hours until the cervix was favorable for amniotomy, spontaneous rupture of membranes or active labor occurred.",12512928,receive 100 m g oral misoprostol every 3 hours,i.Procedure,ml
5,32 ||| Materials and Methods ||| 2.19 ||| These women were then offered a choice of being delivered by cesarean section (CS) or having 50 m g misoprostol vaginally after the resting period of 6-24 hours.,12512928,50 m g misoprostol vaginally,i.Procedure,ml
6,"39 ||| Results ||| 3.5 ||| However, oxytocin requirement and spontaneous rupture of membranes were found more in the 6 hour group.",12512928,oxytocin requirement and spontaneous rupture,i.DiagnosticTest,ml
7,"58 ||| Discussion ||| 4.8 ||| While 50 m g oral misoprostol used every 4-6 hours was less effective than 200 m g, with the interval from induction to vaginal delivery varied from 17.86 ± 9.88 hours to 37.9 ± 41 hours, the hyperstimulation syndrome was reported to be from 0% to 13%.",12512928,the interval from induction to vaginal delivery varied from 17.86 ± 9.88 hours to 37.9 ± 41 hours,i.SS,ml
8,"55 ||| Discussion ||| 4.5 ||| The use of 200 m g oral misoprostol every 6 hours was very effective, and the interval from induction to vaginal delivery was 12.49 ± 7.73 hours but there were 38.7% of cases with tachysystole and 44.1% with hyperstimulation syndrome.",12512928, was very effective,o.Patient,ml
9,"6 |||  ||| 0.6 ||| Conclusions: 100 m g oral misoprostol every 3 hours is more effective for labor induction than every 6 hours but there was no difference in mode of delivery, analgesic requirement, maternal complications and neonatal outcome.",12512928, more effective for labor induction,o.Patient,ml
10,"70 ||| Discussion ||| 4.20 ||| In conclusion, 100 m g oral misoprostol every 3 hours demonstrated the higher efficacy in terms of treatment interval than every 6 hours.",12512928, higher efficacy in terms of treatment interval,o.Treatment,ml
11,"72 ||| Discussion ||| 4.22 ||| According to these findings, we conclude that 100 m g oral misoprostol every 3 hours appears to be effective with acceptable safety for labor induction in a case of unfavorable cervix.",12512928,effective with acceptable safety for labor induction,o.Treatment,ml
