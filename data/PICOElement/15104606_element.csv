1,"23 ||| METHODS ||| 2.3 ||| Inclusion criteria included a singleton pregnancy in cephalic presentation at a gestation of 37 weeks or more, with a medical or obstetric indication for induction, an unfavourable cervix (modified Bishop's score of less than 8) and intact membranes.",15104606,a singleton pregnancy in cephalic presentation,pr.Disease,ml
2,4 |||  ||| 0.4 ||| Population Two hundred women at term with indications for labour induction and modified Bishop's cervical score of less than 8.,15104606,Two hundred women,po.Size,ml
3,"25 ||| METHODS ||| 2.5 ||| After full informed consent, women were randomly assigned to receive oral misoprostol or vaginal PGE 2 tablet by means of a computer generated random table, with the allocation concealed in cards in sequentially numbered, opaque envelopes.",15104606,assigned to receive oral misoprostol or vaginal PGE 2 tablet,i.Procedure,ml
4,"28 ||| METHODS ||| 2.8 ||| Women assigned to the oral misoprostol received a 100 Ag misoprostol tablet (Cytotec, Searle Pharmaceuticals, Ontario, Canada) orally and the dose could be repeated every 4 hours to a maximum of five doses.",15104606,assigned to the oral misoprostol received a 100 Ag misoprostol tablet,i.Procedure,ml
5,"33 ||| METHODS ||| 2.13 ||| If a diagnosis of labour was made or the cervical Bishop's score was 8 or more, the woman was transferred to the labour ward for artificial rupture of membranes.",15104606,a diagnosis of labour,i.Diagnostic,ml
6,39 ||| METHODS ||| 2.19 ||| The main measure of efficacy was taken to be the number of women delivering vaginally within 24 hours of the first dose of prostaglandin in the two groups.,15104606,the number of women delivering vaginally within 24 hours,i.DiagnosticTest,ml
7,"44 ||| METHODS ||| 2.24 ||| Assuming that 40% of women receiving vaginal PGE 2 would deliver within 24 hours of the induction, 6 our sample size was calculated to detect a 25% increase in this number (to 65%) in the misoprostol group (power 90%, a ¼ 0.10, h ¼ 0.10, Instat Version 3.01, GraphPad Software, San Deigo, California, USA).",15104606,deliver within 24 hours of the induction,i.SS,ml
8,"48 ||| METHODS ||| 2.28 ||| Of the 75 women in the misoprostol group and the 73 women in the PGE 2 group who delivered vaginally, 50.7% and 54.8%, respectively, did so within 24 hours of the administration of the first dose of the inducing agent (RR 0.92, 95% CI 0.7 to 1.3, Table 2).",15104606,did so within 24 hours of the administration,i.SS,ml
9,"5 |||  ||| 0.5 ||| Methods The women were randomly allocated to receive either 100 Ag of misoprostol orally (which could be repeated 4 hourly to a maximum of five doses if indicated), or a 3 mg tablet of prostaglandin E 2 vaginally (which could be repeated in 6 hours, according to routine departmental protocol).",15104606,randomly allocated to receive either 100 Ag of misoprostol orally,i.Procedure,ml
10,"51 ||| METHODS ||| 2.31 ||| While there were no cases of uterine hyperstimulation in the PGE 2 group, two primiparous women needed salbutamol in the misoprostol group.",15104606, no cases of uterine hyperstimulation in the PGE 2 group,i.Disease,ml
11,56 ||| METHODS ||| 2.36 ||| Three other women had evidence of tachysystole while on oxytocin augmentation following priming with misoprostol.,15104606, evidence of tachysystole,i.Disease,ml
12,57 ||| METHODS ||| 2.37 ||| Two women in the misoprostol group and one in the PGE 2 group had abdominal delivery for failure of cervical ripening with the inducing agents.,15104606,abdominal delivery for failure of cervical ripening with the inducing agents,i.Disease,ml
13,"67 ||| DISCUSSION ||| 3.9 ||| A 200 Ag oral dose was more effective than dinoprostone intracervically, 12 however, Adair et al.",15104606,was more effective than dinoprostone intracervically,o.Treatment,ml
14,"9 |||  ||| 0.9 ||| More women in the misoprostol group were given oxytocin, but this was not statistically significant (60% vs 47%, RR 1.3, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.7).",15104606,was not statistically significant ,o.Patient,ml
