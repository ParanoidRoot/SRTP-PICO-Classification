6,"30 ||| Subjects ||| 3.19 ||| Because the study had two primary objectives, it was to be considered positive only if enalapril was more effective than nifedipine for both LV mass reduction and normalization of LV diastolic filling at a value of PϽ0.05 or if one comparison had a value of PϽ0.025.",11551875,LV mass reduction and normalization of LV diastolic filling,i.Procedure,limingqi
7,69 ||| Discussion ||| 6.2 ||| The most important result of the study is that regimens based on once-daily administration of enalapril or long-acting nifedipine significantly reduced LV mass index and relative wall thickness during 1 year of treatment: LV mass index was reduced to the normal range in 56% of enalapril-treated patients and 48% of nifedipine-treated patients.,11551875,significantly reduced LV mass index and relative wall thickness during 1 year of treatment,o.Treatment,limingqi
