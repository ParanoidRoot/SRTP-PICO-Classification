0,1 |||  ||| 0.1 ||| Objective To compare the active management of term prelabour rupture of membranes with oral misoprostol with conservative management for 24 hours followed by induction with oxytocin or prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) gel.,12504970,compare the active management of term prelabour rupture of membranes with oral misoprostol ,pr.Disease,ml
1,"26 ||| INTRODUCTION ||| 1.13 ||| Our aim in this randomised controlled trial was to see if active management with oral misoprostol resulted in significantly more women going into labour within 24 hours of the prelabour rupture of membranes, and to assess patient preferences for management.",12504970, active management with oral misoprostol resulted in significantly more women going into labour within 24 hours,pr.Disease,ml
2,4 |||  ||| 0.4 ||| Population Sixty-one women with confirmed prelabour rupture of the membranes at !,12504970,Sixty-one women,po.Size,ml
3,"49 ||| METHODS ||| 2.22 ||| In those women randomised to the conservative arm, if labour had not set in by 24 hours of the prelabour rupture of membranes, a vaginal examination was performed to evaluate the cervical score (modified Bishop's score).",12504970,randomised to the conservative arm,i.Procedure,ml
4,"5 |||  ||| 0.5 ||| Methods The women were randomised to 50 Ag of oral misoprostol repeated every 4 hours, if required, to a maximum of five doses (active group), or to induction of labour with PGE 2 gel or oxytocin only if not in spontaneous labour 24 hours after prelabour rupture of membranes (conservative group).",12504970,were randomised to 50 Ag of oral misoprostol repeated every 4 hours,i.Procedure,ml
5,"7 |||  ||| 0.7 ||| Results 93.3% of the active group and 54.8% of the conservative group were in spontaneous labour within 24 hours of the prelabour rupture of membranes (RR 1.7, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.4).",12504970,conservative group were in spontaneous labour ,i.Disease,ml
6,78 ||| RESULTS ||| 3.17 ||| Three women in either group had pyrexia of 38jC noted in active labour and received prophylactic antibiotic cover.,12504970,pyrexia of 38jC,i.Disease,ml
7,"8 |||  ||| 0.8 ||| Of those achieving a vaginal delivery, 72% of the active group did so within 24 hours of the prelabour rupture of membranes as compared with 26.9% of the conservative group (RR 2.7, 95% CI 1.4 to 5.3, P Â¼ 0.002).",12504970,within 24 hours of the prelabour rupture of membranes,i.Disease,ml
8,11 |||  ||| 0.11 ||| Conclusions Active management with oral misoprostol resulted in more women going into labour and delivering within 24 hours of the prelabour rupture of membranes with no increase in maternal or neonatal complications.,12504970,more women going into labour and delivering within 24 hours,o.Patient,ml

10,"68 ||| RESULTS ||| 3.7 ||| The rupture of membranes to delivery time was significantly shorter in the  Of the 31 women in the conservative group, nine (29%) had a cervical score of >6 at 24 hours after the rupture of membranes and were given oxytocin only, while five women (16.2%) were given PGE 2 gel as they had cervical scores of 6, the rest (54.8%) being in spontaneous labour within 24 hours of the prelabour rupture of membranes.",12504970,delivery time was significantly shorter,o.Treatment,ml
11,"71 ||| RESULTS ||| 3.10 ||| Oxytocin augmentation was given in 11 women in the active group (36.7%) and in 14 women (nine who went into spontaneous labour, and all the five who received PGE 2 gel) in the conservative group.",12504970,Oxytocin augmentation,o.Treatment,ml
12,90 ||| DISCUSSION ||| 4.2 ||| Our results suggest that active treatment does result in shorter prelabour rupture of membranes to delivery times with significantly more patients going into labour and delivering within 24 hours of the prelabour rupture of membranes.,12504970,active treatment does result in shorter prelabour rupture of membranes to delivery times,o.Treatment,ml
13,"99 ||| DISCUSSION ||| 4.11 ||| In conclusion, oral misoprostol might be an option to consider in those women wishing to be actively managed following prelabour rupture of membranes at term.",12504970,might be an option to consider in those women wishing to be actively managed,o.Patient,ml
