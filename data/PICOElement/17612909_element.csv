4,26 ||| Introduction ||| 1.15 ||| The aim of the present study was therefore twofold: first to describe the relation between blood flow velocity and brachial artery FMD and second to compare the effect of antihypertensive therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and a beta-blocker on brachial artery as well as small artery endothelium-mediated relaxation.,17612909,compare the effect of antihypertensive therapy with an angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and a beta-blocker on brachial artery as well as small artery endothelium-mediated relaxation,pr.SS,limingqi
