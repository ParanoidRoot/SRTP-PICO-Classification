10,"70 ||| Results ||| 3.11 ||| It was observed that of the women needing oxytocin after receiving two doses of misoprostol, 71% needed oxytocin  within 4-6 h of misoprostol and the rest needed it after 6 h whereas, among women who needed oxytocin ≥ 4 doses of misoprostol, 72% required it after 6 h. Thus, as the number of doses of misoprostol increased, the proportion of women needing oxytocin augmentation at a later interval (> 6 h) increased.",16866794,"as the number of doses of misoprostol increased, the proportion of women needing oxytocin augmentation at a later interval (> 6 h) increased.",o.Treatment,ZhouJiaying
