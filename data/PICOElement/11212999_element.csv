10,16 |||  ||| 0.16 ||| Vaginal misoprostol may be associated with higher rates of caesarean section than oral misoprostol.,11212999,higher rates of caesarean section,o.Treatment,ZhouJiaying
11,"90 ||| DISCUSSION ||| 4.4 ||| Although there was no statistically significant difference between oral and vaginal misoprostol with respect to emergency caesarean sections, it is important to note that there were more emergency caesarean sections in the vaginal group.",11212999,no statistically significant difference,o.Treatment,ZhouJiaying
